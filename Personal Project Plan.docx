Work on Final Deliverables Draft
Work on Academic Poster

Mainly in this time period is working on the final deliverables, poster, and bug fixing. This period is mainly a flexable period for me to find the time to do the various things tasked for my project and in the class.

This period also allows me to set up my secondary PC to support the website and host it before the final presentation. I will also be keeping the GitHub link online if anything is to go wrong.
